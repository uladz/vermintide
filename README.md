# Installation Process

If you already have some form of mods (whether it's an old version or otherwise), you will want to overwrite the mods folder and all other files with those from this download. However, be wary of erasing stored data in mods/patch/storage while updating.

If you have no previous installation, follow these 3 simple steps :

1. Click the reddit link and then the download link found there to download the .zip compressed folder.
2. Unpack the full contents of the .zip in **exactly** *Steam/SteamApps/common/Warhammer End Times Vermintide/binaries*
3. Good to go! Start up your game.

# Chat Commands

The list of chat commands goes as follow : /deathwish, /mutation, /slayer, /onslaught, /killbots, /downbots, /fail, /reload, /ban, /missionstats, /lorebook, /remind.

'Deathwish', 'Mutation', 'Slayer' and 'Onslaught' will toggle on and off their respective gamemodes. Details about them below.

'Killbots' and 'Downbots' will, as one would expect, either kill or incapacitate all bots instantly. It can only be used at the beginning of a match.

'Fail' will instantly trigger a defeated screen, allowing for a faster map restart/return to inn without the need to disband an ongoing party.

'Reload' should under normal circumstances not see use, but may serve as a temporary fix to minor bugs of the mods.

'Ban' is used to ban users that were recently kicked by you. Without a recently kicked user, it will do nothing.

'Missionstats' will paste into the chat your mission completion stats, for both adventure and last stand.

'Lorebook' will tell you how many pages you have unlocked/left to unlock on every map.

'Remind' will store a custom message until the end of your mission and then say it back to you.

# Mod List

This download features several mods which can and will affect normal gameplay, in a non-cheaty way. Most of them are highly customizable and can be toggled on and off in-game using an user-friendly settings menu interface.

Here's a list of them :

**Player List Ping Display** : The player list will display numerical ping values to let you know how good or bad your connection or that of your players is.

**Player List Equipment Display** : Credits to Walterr, this mod will show on the player list the current weapons and trinkets of every member of your team, letting you know at a glance who has what.

**Player List Kicking & Banning** : When you are hosting, you may now instantly kick players with the player list interface. Then, you may ban them by typing */ban* into your chat.

**Chat Blocking** : When opening the chat during missions, you will now automatically block attacks, and push as you exit the chat (as long as your stamina allows it). This mod can be toggled on and off in-game in the mods setting menu.

**Bot improvements** : The bots improvements are a variety of modifications to the bots created by both Walterr and myself that turn the bots into competent teammates that can stand even double grimoire cataclysm, if equipped properly and led by a competent player. Highly customizable, all of this mod's individual features can be turned on and off at will in the mod settings menu.

**Third Person Mode** : Credits to Grasmann, a serious take on what Vermintide would look like as an 'over the shoulder' 3rd person game. Customizable keybindings allow to switch between 3rd and 1st person on the move, and adjust camera offsets to one's preference.

**Enemy Health Bars** : Credits to Grasmann once more, this mod gives damaged skaven units health bars. The types of units (if any) that will receive health bars is fully customizable.

**Floating Damage Numbers** : Also credits to Grasmann, this mod will render MMO-styled damage numbers over the heads of units you and your team strike. Can be customized to choose who's damage is displayed.

**Loadout Saver** : Credits to Walterr, this mod adds a loadout interface to the inventory, letting you save up to 9 equipment loadouts per hero and quickly load them back up.

**Inventory Filtering** : Credit to /u/Grundlid, this mod adds a filtering UI and commands to the inventory, forge and shrine alongside the ability to add items as favorite that will not show up on salvage.

**Crosshair Customization** : Credits to /u/Grundlid, this simple mod lets you recolor your crosshair and/or make it thicker, should you want to.

**Ammo Meters** : Blue meters attached to the unit frames of your teammates who have ammo (requires other players to also have the QoL modpack), that tell you how much they have left.

**Buff UI Timers** : Credits to /u/Grundlid, adds timers on the UI that show the remaining duration of active potions and attack speed traits.

**Trueflight Tweaks** : Credits to Walterr, this mod lets you customize minor aspects of the trueflight and bolt staff behaviour, such as prioritization of the red targeting outline over blue pings. All changes disabled by default.

**Third Person Equipment** : Credits to Grasmann, this mod displays unequipped weapons and items on the back of heroes.

**Luck & Dupe Indicators** : Credits to /u/Grundlid, this mod adds small reminders over chests and items about luck and dupe trinkets when appropriate.

**HUD Enhancements** : Credits to Walterr, /u/Grundlid and /dev/null, this package of several different mini-mods features an alternate display for friendly fire damage, dynamic overcharge markers for the wizard and dwarf, party trinkets indicators, allows you to see potion types on the ground while carrying a grimoire, a scoreboard fix for damage taken while already downed, the ability to disable bloodlust/regrowth screen FX, an efficient dodge indicator and the ability to always display the gamepad HUD. All features disabled by default.

**HUD Toggle** : Credits to UnShame, this simple mod allows you to toggle on and off all HUD elements at will, both with the mod settings menu and with customizable keybinds.

**Sound Settings** : Credits to /u/Aussiemon, this mod allows you to toggle off various proc feedback sounds.

**Grimoire Discard Saver** : Credits to /u/chrisplusk, this mod changes the discard grimoire input to require push + block instead of a simple left click, to avoid accidental discards.

**Lobby Improvements** : Credits to /dev/null, this mod features a new heroes column in the lobby browser displaying played heroes, the ability to skip the 'Prepare Yourselves' countdown when hosting or joining a game in progress, the ability to alter your spawn to be close to a player when joining a game in progess, and the ability to blacklist lobbies in the lobby browser.

**Salvage on Loottable** : Credits to IamLupo, this mod adds a button to instantly salvage loot obtained by a dice roll at the end of a mission.

**Scoreboard Improvements** : Credits to /u/Grundlid, this mod adds new stat sections to the scoreboard that track self-inflicted damage, friendly fire and health/ammo return weapon procs, as well as allowing you to sort the stats in a premade order, and improve the behaviour of the damage taken stat.

**DLC Skin Disabler** : This simple mod adds options in the mod setting menu to toggle off owned DLC skins without the need of a game restart.

**Change Weapon Models** : Credits to /dev/null, this mod allows you to swap the model of your weapons with that of another quality of the same type, in a manner visible only to you.

**Cheat Protection** : While using this download, cheaters will be blocked from spawning items such as grimoires or ammo boxes in your games. They will also be blocked from requesting to be healed when they shouldn't be. Any attempt will produce a chat message visible by everyone that states who attempted to do what.

**Disconnection Resilience** : While using this download, your games will no longer be terminated as soon as connection to steam and/or the game servers is lost. A system is now set in place to keep your game running until its completion, alongside other players who have not been disconnected, or also have this mod.

# Known Issues

**Bot improvements** : Under extreme circumstances which should never occur during normal gameplay, the 'Keep Tome' feature can affect performance. This can only happen if all 3 bots are wielding tomes, and there are over 20 medical items laying around in close proximity to them. Honestly though, there's never that many meds around unless you're doing shady stuff, so don't worry about it.

**Chat Block** : Automatic pushes when exiting chat cost double stamina if using a shield.

**Mods.gui** : May rarely for some users display that error : https://imgur.com/XXthjm7 when first starting the game. If this happens to you, use /reload before opening any menus, to avoid issues.

# About the Difficulty Mods

**The Stormvermin Mutation** : All slave rats are replaced by clan rats. All original clan rats are replaced with stormvermins. All specials are replaced with ogres. Chaos ensues. Playable on any difficulty, although the recommended difficulty is hard for full, serious group play, and easy or normal for play with bots or with an inexperienced team. Psychopaths may also attempt nightmare and cataclysm. Funeral costs are not covered.

**Deathwish Difficulty** : If you thought the jump from nightmare to cataclysm was bad, then just you wait. A serious take on "what if there was a difficulty after cataclysm?" to give even the best of the best a serious challenge.

http://pastebin.com/qfAJd5S0 <-- Here's a simple description of what it changes compared to cataclysm.

**Last Stand - Slayer's Oath waveset** : 13 fully custom Last Stand waves compatible with Deathwish Difficulty, but also playable on lower difficulties. Features insane combinations of skaven never seen anywhere before that will make short work of you should your discipline falter. Stand proud and tall, hero, for this is your last chance to do so.

**Adventure Mode - Onslaught** : "The onslaught will not end, and your only way out is forward. Remember, they're numberless." Onslaught features massively increased spawn rates for ambient rats, hordes, specials and boss events, as well as a crazy redesign of all map specific events. Playable on all difficulties.

# Closing Words

This modpack possesses alot of features, not all of which were made by me. In a perfect world, everything should work as intended beyond the known issues, but it is not impossible that problems arise. If this is the case, by all means post the problem in the comments, and I will do my best to have it fixed ASAP.

And obviously, if you have any questions, or suggestions about features I should include, feel free to ask!

Only keep in mind that the purpose of this modpack is to stay away from things that give a significant advantage to a player or allow griefing, and that I also shy away from features that output large amounts of text into the chat box.

Enjoy!
